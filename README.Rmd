`loc` provides a single function, `count_loc()`, whose purpose is to count lines
of code. You can provide specific paths to include or exclude, consider hidden
files or not, and you have access to a [long list of languages](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-languages).

Under the hood, `loc` uses the [`tokei`](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei)
Rust crate.


## Installation

### Windows or macOS

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  'loc', 
  repos = c('https://etiennebacher.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos"))
)
```

### Linux

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  'loc', 
  repos = c('https://etiennebacher.r-universe.dev/bin/linux/jammy/4.3', getOption("repos"))
)
```


## Example

Here's what was needed to make this package:

```{r}
library(loc)

count_loc(paths = c("R", "src"), languages = c("R", "Rust"))
```
