`loc` provides a single function, `count_loc()`, whose purpose is to
count lines of code. You can provide specific paths to include or
exclude, consider hidden files or not, and you have access to a [long
list of
languages](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-languages).

Under the hood, `loc` uses the
[`tokei`](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) Rust crate.

## Installation

## Example

Hereâ€™s what was needed to make this package:

``` r
library(loc)

count_loc(paths = c("R", "src"), languages = c("R", "Rust"))
